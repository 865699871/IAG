# IAG for three Papaver species
To figure out what genome structural changes occured to shape the present-day karyotypes of three Papaver species. We developed a novel bottom-up framework IAG (inferring ancestor genome) to reconstruct pre- and post-WGD-1 ancestors of Papaver genomes. This is a pipline only for Papaver species. And a more user-friendly version is being developed.
